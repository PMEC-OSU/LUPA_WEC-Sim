# LUPA WEC-Sim Model — Fall 2023

This is the ReadMe for the LUPA WEC-Sim model based on the experimental testing in **Fall 2023** at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory in Corvallis, OR, USA. This was the second LUPA testing and the only configuration tested was the two-body, 6DOF LUPA configuration.  
For information on the other two configurations, see **LUPA Fall 2022**.

The model references:
- `.stl` files in the `geometry` folder
- `.h5` files in the `hydroData` folder
- WAMIT input and output files (also provided)
