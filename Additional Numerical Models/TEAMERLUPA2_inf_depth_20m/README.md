# LUPA WEC-Sim Model â€” Fall 2023

This is the ReadMe for the **20 m** LUPA WEC-Sim model with *infinite water depth* based on the experimental testing in **Fall 2023** at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory in Corvallis, OR, USA. 
For information on the other two configurations, see **LUPA Fall 2022**.

**NOTE:** This *scaled* model is set at *infinite water depth* and cannot be used for validation with experimental data.

The model references:
- `.stl` files in the `geometry` folder
- `.h5` files in the `hydroData` folder
- WAMIT input and output files (also provided)

## Basic Details

- **Water depth:** infinite
- **Scale-size:** 20x experimentally tested TEAMERLUPA2
- **Changes from LUPA Fall 2022:** spar design and water depth

## Software Versions

- **WEC-Sim version:** v6.1.2  
- **MATLAB version:** R2023b
