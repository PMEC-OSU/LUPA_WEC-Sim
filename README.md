# LUPA_WEC-Sim
WEC-Sim models of LUPA device

This is the ReadMe for the LUPA WEC-Sim models based on the experimental testing in Fall 2022.

The input parameters are estimated in Beringer et al., a paper in the review and editing stage of publishing.

The three LUPA configurations are given as One-Body Heave-Only, Two-Body Heave-Only, and Two-Body Six-DOF. 
The models reference the .stl files in the geometry folder and the .h5 files in the hydroData folder. 
Each configuration has its own wecSimInputFile, Simulink file, and userDefinedFunctions post processing code.
